You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your `$HOME` directory or `~`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tapyu/dotfiles
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```shell
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the README)
```

```shell
stow zsh # Just my zsh config
```


Set of config file that is meant to be used with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xMTKml9O0&ab_channel=chris%40machine) for more info.
